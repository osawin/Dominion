# Dominion
This program implements the game Dominion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)). It is currently incomplete.
It can be compiled and run in the command line. It looks for a single argument, which must be an integer, which sets the number of players. If no argument is given, it defaults to 2 players. 
It accepts input from System.in, and gives output to System.out, both in the form of text.
