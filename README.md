# Dominion
This program implements the game Dominion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)). It is currently incomplete.
It can be compiled and run in the command line. Currently it does not accept arguments, though I plan to add at least on argument to set the number of players.
It accepts input from System.in, and gives output to System.out, both in the form of text.
